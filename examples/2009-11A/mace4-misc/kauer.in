% Dear Prof. McCune,
% 
% I found the following problem: the following 3 axioms for a relation <
% are given:
%       1. all x exists y: x < y
%       2. all x y: x < y => not y < x 
%       3. all x y: x < y => exists z: x < z and z < y
% 
% One has to find a finite model. It is surprising and not obvious, that a
% finite model exists, and it is not at all to find easily (at least for
% me, may be for you). Since I sometimes work with OTTER, I remembered
% MACE and tried to formulate and solve this problem with MACE, but
% unfortunately was able to do it. 
% Is it possible to formulate and solve this problem with MACE and how?
% 
% This problem was posed as an exercise in a very small german
% mathematical magazin by Dr. Waldmann, a former colleague of mine, who
% works now at another university. We both agree that the smallest model
% has seven elements.
% 
% Sincerely yours
