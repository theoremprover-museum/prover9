Hi Bill,

Here is a Problem on quasigroups which might be amenable for  
treatment by Otter, Mace and Prover9.

A Sample Theorem (due to R.P. and Barry Wolk)

Let K be the set of all algebras of type (2) satisfying the four  
identities given below.

     1. (x * E) * x = x.
     2. x* (x * y) = y.
     3. (x * y) * (z * u) = (x * z) * (y * u).
     4. ((x * x) * x) * x = ((y * y) * y) * y  (=E).

Then K satisfies all the identities valid in the ring model (Z[7]; 3x- 
y). In other words, the variety K has a solvable word problem!
Also every model of K is imbeddable in a quasigroup.

Solution to the word problem is given like this: An identity f=g is a  
consequence of {1,2,3,4} if and only if it is true in the ring model  
mentioned above.

Applying MACE and OTTER to prove the above statements.

Step#1.
MACE. Get a ring model. A non-trivial one must be x*y = 3x - y (mod 7).

Step#2.
Use Otter to derive the two cancellation laws.
Right cancellation is obvious: x*y = x*z  => x*(x*y) = x*(x*z)  =>   
y=z  by (2).
Left cancellation law: x*z = y*z => x=y also follows from the above  
but not obvious and Otter will love proving this.

Step#3
Prove that E (defined in Id #4) is idempotent.

Human Steps.
By a result of M. Sholander, any cancellative medial groupoid with an  
idempotent element is imbeddable in a medial quasigroup satisfying  
the same identities of the original algebra. So any algebra belonging  
to K is a sugroupoid of such a quasigroup. Finally, the classic  
Toyoda-Bruck theorem asserts that every medial quasigroup is isotopic  
to an abelian group i.e. a ring model. So x*y = ax + by and plugging  
in the above four equations, one shows that 3x-y (mod 7) is the only  
solution for this set of equations.

In particular, the identity ((x * y) * z) * u = ((u * y) * z) * x,  
which is true in the ring model 3x-y (mod 7), must now be an  
equational  consequence of the four identites. This creates new  
problems for Otter, Prover9.
Prove this using Otter or Prover9.
Again, two methods.

Method I
Prove directly    {1,2,3,4} ==> ((x * y) * z) * u = ((u * y) * z) * x.
Method II.
Prove ((x * y) * z) * u = ((u * y) * z) * x from {1,2,3,4, quasigroup  
property, skolemize i.e. type (2,2,2) with*,/,\ }.

Obviously Method I is preferable.

Thus we have a very good example of a theorem differentiating the  
"simplicity-and-elegance" of a human proof compared to the  
"complexity-in-details" of a first order proof. Also, there is no  
immediate first order human proof of
{1,2,3,4} ==> ((x * y) * z) * u = ((u * y) * z) * x.
But theorem-provers can do this.

Conjecture: This variety defined by the four identities above is one- 
based.
If true, only machines can do this (using, of course, human designed  
equational filters to eliminate "bad" guys).


Other (relatively easy) Problems:

Prove that x*(y*(y*x)) = y*x  implies y*(y*x) = x*y in quasigroups  
but not in cancellative groupoids.
Prove that (x*y)*(z*u) = (x*z)*(y*u) implies (x(yz))((uv)w) = (x(uz)) 
((yv)w) in cancellation groupoids with an idempotent or under (gL)  
but not in general. (Prover9, Otter with 9gL), Mace).

Yes, I knew about the ternary algebra problem. It was considered by  
Ervin Fried in connection with dual discriminator varieties. I gave  
an otter proof of a similar result to Ervin when he was here a couple  
of years ago. Yes, Otter and Prover9 can do a lot of proofs in these  
areas of Universal algebra. We have not tapped them yet. May be our  
future projects.

Good luck with your conference.
