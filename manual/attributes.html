<h1>Attributes</h1>

Several kinds of attribute can be attached to input formulas
with the <tt>#</tt> operator, for example,

<pre class="my_file">
x * y = y * x              # label(commutativity).
x * c != e                 # answer(x) # label("the denial").
-p(c) | -q(c)              # answer("here it is").
a * b != b * a             # action(in_proof -> exit) # answer(commutativity).
x * (y * z) = y * (x * z)  # bsub_hint_wt(500).
</pre>

Each attribute has a data type of string, integer, or term.
A string attribute is really just a term attribute that is
a constant.  If a string attribute is not a legal constant,
it can be enclosed in double quotes to make it so.

<p>
Attributes can be attached only to the top level of a formula;
they cannot be attached to proper subformulas.
(This restriction might be lifted in future versions of Prover9.)

<p>
The accepted attributes are shown in the following table.

<p>
<table "border" align="center" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<th>Name              <th> Type     <th> Inheritable  <th> Purpose
<tr>
<td>label             <td> string   <td> No           <td> Comment
<tr>
<td>answer            <td> term     <td> Yes          <td> Record substitutions and what has been proved
<tr>
<td>action            <td> term     <td> No           <td> Triggers action when clause is used
<!--
<tr>
<td>action2           <td> term     <td> Yes          <td> Triggers action when clause is used
-->
<tr>
<td>bsub_hint_wt      <td> integer  <td> No           <td> Used for hints
</table>

<p>
Inheritable attributes are passed from parent to child during most
inference rules.

<h2>Label Attributes</h2>

Label attributes are simply comments that can be attached to input clauses,
including hint clauses.

<h2>Answer Attributes</h2>

Answer attributes on clauses are essentially answer literals.
They are inherited during application of inference rules, and if they contain
variables, the variables are instantiated by the substitution
used in the inference.
<p>
Answer attributes (like all other attributes) contain exactly
one argument.  If you wish to record substitutions for more
than one variable, you must use a term that contains all of the
variables, for example, a list, as in the following clause.
<pre class="my_file">
-p(c,x,y,z)  # answer([x,y,z]).
</pre>
Answer attributes need not contain variables.  For example,
when there are multiple goals, answer attributes can be used on
the goal formulas to identify the goals that are proved.
<p>
Answer attributes on non-clausal formulas cannot contain variables.
(This restriction might be lifted in future versions of Prover9.)

<h2>Action Attributes</h2>

Action attributes cause various things to happen when
clauses are used in various ways.
See the <a href="actions.html">section on Actions</a>.
<!--
<p>
The only difference between <tt>action</tt> and <tt>action2</tt> attributes
is that <tt>action2</tt> attributes are inherited during inferences.
-->

<h2>Bsub_hint_wt Attribute</h2>

This attribute can be attached to a hint clause, and it is used
to override ordinary weight assigned to clauses that match the hint.
That is, if a hint matches
a clause, and if the hint has a
<a href="hints.html#bsub_hint_wt"><tt><b>bsub_hint_wt</b></tt></a> attribute,
the clause gets the value of the attribute as its weight instead
of the weight that would be assigned by the ordinary weighting
method.
