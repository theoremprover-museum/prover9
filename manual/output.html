<h1>Output Files</h1>

Even when Prover9 fails to find a proof, its output file
usually has lots of valuable information about the search.
The output file can suggest many ways of improving the
search for subsequent jobs as in the following examples.

<ul>
<li>The output shows how equalities are oriented; different
<a href="term-order.html">term ordering parameters</a>
may give better or more intuitive orientations.
<li>If Prover9 focused the search on uninteresting clauses
(see the sequence of given clauses), different
<a href="inf-rules.html">inference rules</a>, a different
<a href="select.html#pick_given_ratio"><tt><b>pick_given_ratio</b></tt></a>, or a specialized
<a href="weight.html">weighting function</a>
can be used.
<li>If Prover9 ran out of time or memory with a huge <tt>sos</tt> list
and small <tt>usable</tt> list (i.e., few given clauses were used),
the <a href="limits.html#sos_limit"><tt><b>sos_limit</b></tt></a> should be reduced.
</ul>

<h2>Basic Structure of Output Files</h2>

Prover9 output files are divided into sections and subsections
so the users (people and programs) can find what they are looking
for.  The delimiters are self-explanatory.  A few comments about
the sections are given here.  For a specific example, see
the output file <a href="subset_trans.out">subset_trans.out</a>.

<pre class="my_file">
============================== Prover9 ===============================
    <font color="#D10000"><i>Version, date, host computer, command</a>.</i></font>
============================== end of head ===========================

============================== INPUT =================================
    <font color="#D10000"><i>Echo of the input.  Everything in this section that is not
    in the input is commented with "%", so copy-and-paste can be
    done on this section to create a new input file.</i></font>
============================== end of input ==========================

============================== PROCESS GOALS =========================
    <font color="#D10000"><i>The search is always by refutation, and this section shows
    how goals are negated in preparation for the search.</i></font>
============================== end of process goals ==================

============================== PROCESS INITIAL CLAUSES ===============
    <font color="#D10000"><i>This section shows the starting clauses (after Skomemization,
    if applicable) and then some of what Prover9 does in preparation
    for the search.  This includes <a href="more-prep.html#predicate_elim"><tt><b>predicate_elim</b></tt></a>, term ordering
    decisions, and <a href="auto.html#auto_inference"><tt><b>auto_inference</b></tt></a> settings.  At this stage, clauses
    may be deleted by subsumption and equations may be copied to the
    list <tt>demodulators</tt>.  See the flag <a href="more-prep.html#process_initial_sos"><tt><b>process_initial_sos</b></tt></a>.</i></font>

<h2>Clause Justifications</h2>

After the initial stage of the output, each clause in the file has an
integer identifier (ID) and a justification that may refer to IDs
of other clauses.  A justification is a list consisting of one
primary step and some number of secondary steps.  Most primary steps
are inference rules applied to given clauses, and most secondary
steps consist of simplification, rewriting, or orienting equalities.

<p>
Many of the types of step refer to positions of literals or terms
in the parent clauses.  Literals are identified by the characters
'a' (first literal), 'b' (second literal), etc.  Terms are identified
by the literal identifier followed by a sequence of integers giving
the position of the term within the literal.  For example, the
position 'c,1,3,2' means third literal, first argument, third
argument, second argument.  Negation signs on literals are not
included in the sequence.

<p>
Primary Steps.

<ul>
<li><tt>assumption</tt> -- input formula.
<li><tt>clausify</tt> -- from CNF translation of a non-clausal assumption.
<li><tt>goal</tt> -- input formula.
<li><tt>deny</tt> -- from CNF translation of the negation of a goal.
<li><tt>resolve(59,b,47,c)</tt> -- resolve the second literal of clause 59
     with the third literal of clause 47.
<li><tt>hyper(59, b,47,a, c,38,a)</tt> -- hyperresolution; interpret the
    list as a clause ID followed by a sequence of triples,
    &lt;literal,clause-ID,literal&gt; the inference is presented as a sequence
    of binary resolution steps.  In the example shown, start with clause 59;
    then resolve literal b with clause 47 on literal a; with the result of
    the first step, resolve literal c with clause 38 on literal a.
    The special case "<tt>xx</tt>" means resolution with <tt>x=x</tt>.
<li><tt>ur(39, a,48,a, b,88,a, c,87,a, d,86,a)</tt> -- unit-resulting
    resolution; the list is interpreted as in hyperresolution.
<li><tt>para(47(a,1),28(a,1,2,2,1))</tt> -- paramodulate from the clause 47
    into clause 28 at the positions shown.
<li><tt>copy(59)</tt> -- copy clause 59.
<li><tt>back_rewite(59)</tt> -- copy clause 59.
<li><tt>back_unit_del(59)</tt> -- copy clause 59.
<li><tt>new_symbol(59)</tt> -- introduce a new constant (see parameter
    <a href="inf-rules.html#new_constants"><tt><b>new_constants</b></tt></a>).
<li><tt>factor(59,b,c)</tt> -- factor clause 59 by unifying the second
     and third literals.
<li><tt>xx_res(59,b)</tt> -- resolve the second literal of clause 59 with
    <tt>x=x</tt>.
<li><tt>propositional</tt> -- not used in standard proofs.
<li><tt>instantiate</tt> -- not used in standard proofs.
<li><tt>ivy</tt> -- not used in standard proofs.
</ul>

<p>
Secondary Steps (each assumes a working clause, which is either the result of a
primary step or a previous secondary step).
<ul>
<li><tt>rewrite([38(5,R),47(5),59(6,R)])</tt> -- rewriting (demodulation)
    with equations
    38, 47, then 59; the arguments (5), (5), and (6) identify the positions
    of the rewritten subterms (in an obscure way), and the argument R
    indicates that the demodulator is used backward (right-to-left).
<li><tt>flip(c)</tt> -- the third literal is an equality that has been
    flipped by the term ordering.  This does not necessarily mean that
    the equality is orientable by the primary term ordering, e.g., KBO.
<li><tt>merge(d)</tt> -- the fourth literal has been removed because it
    was identical to a preceding literal.
<li><tt>unit_del(b,38)</tt> -- the second literal has been removed because
    it was an instance of the negation clause 38 (which is a unit clause).
<li><tt>xx(b)</tt> -- the second literal has been removed because it was
    an instance of <tt>x!=x</tt>.
</ul>

<h2>Standard Proofs</h2>

Prover9 proofs may be transformed by separate programs,
e.g., by <a href="prooftrans.html">Prooftrans</a>.

<h2>Options That Say What Goes To the Output File </h2>

<!-- start option echo_input -->
<a name="echo_input">
<pre class="my_option">
set(echo_input).    % default set
clear(echo_input).
</pre>

<blockquote>
Clearing this flag suppresses printing of clauses, formulas,
weighting rules (and everything else that ends with <tt>end_of_list</tt>)
that would ordinarily appear in the <tt>INPUT</tt> section of the
output file.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option quiet -->
<a name="quiet">
<pre class="my_option">
set(quiet).
clear(quiet).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes most messages to the standard error file
(usually the user's screen) to be suppressed.
These messages include 
notifications about proofs and statistics reports, and
warnings about demodulation limits.
Setting this flag also suppresses several messages to the ordinary
output file, and it clears the <a href="output.html#bell"><tt><b>bell</b></tt></a> flag.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_initial_clauses -->
<a name="print_initial_clauses">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_initial_clauses).    % default set
clear(print_initial_clauses).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, clauses are printed in the
<tt>PROCESS INITIAL CLAUSES</tt> and
<tt>CLAUSES FOR SEARCH</tt> sections of the output file.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_given -->
<a name="print_given">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_given).    % default set
clear(print_given).
</pre>

<blockquote>
Clearing this flag prevents given clauses from being printed to
the output file.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_gen -->
<a name="print_gen">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_gen).
clear(print_gen).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes all generated clauses to be printed to
the the output file.  In addition, some other information about the
processing of each generated clause is printed.
This flag can be output files to be really huge.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_kept -->
<a name="print_kept">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_kept).
clear(print_kept).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes all kept clauses to be printed to the the output file.
In addition, some other information on the processing of kept clauses is
printed.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_labeled -->
<a name="print_labeled">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_labeled).
clear(print_labeled).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes kept clauses containing label attributes
to be printed, even when the flag <a href="output.html#print_kept"><tt><b>print_kept</b></tt></a> is clear.
This flag is useful when using <a href="hints.html">the hints strategy</a>,
because when a clause matches a hint containing a label, the
label is copied to the clause.  That is, clauses matching labeled hints
will be printed.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_clause_properties -->
<a name="print_clause_properties">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_clause_properties).
clear(print_clause_properties).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes several properties of clauses to
be printed as "props" attributes on the clauses.  The properties
include which literals are maximal (counting from 1), which
literals are maximal among literals of the same sign, and which
literals are selected for application of inference rules.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option print_proofs -->
<a name="print_proofs">
<pre class="my_option">
set(print_proofs).    % default set
clear(print_proofs).
</pre>

<blockquote>
Clearing this flag prevents proofs from being printed to
the output file.  The proof message still goes to the standard
error file (usually the user's screen), unless the flag
<a href="output.html#quiet"><tt><b>quiet</b></tt></a> has been set.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option default_output -->
<a name="default_output">
<pre class="my_option">
set(default_output).    % default set
clear(default_output).
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag restores most of the output flags and parameters
to their default values.
Clearing this flag does nothing.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option report -->
<a name="report">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(report, <i>n</i>).  % default <i>n</i>=-1, range [-1 .. <tt>INT_MAX</tt>]
</pre>

<blockquote>
If <i>n</i> &gt; 0, statistics are sent to the output
file approximately every <i>n</i> seconds.
(On Unix-like systems, one can also tell Prover9 to print statistics to the
output file by sending the signal <tt>USR1</tt> to a
running Prover9 process, e.g., <tt>kill -USR1 4223</tt>.)
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option stats -->
<a name="stats">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(stats, <i>string</i>).  % default <i>string</i>=lots, range [none,some,lots,all]
</pre>

<blockquote>
This parameter determines how many statistics are sent to the output file.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option clocks -->
<a name="clocks">
<pre class="my_option">
set(clocks).
clear(clocks).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, various operations during the Prover9 job
are timed (e.g., inference, demodulation, and subsumption),
and timing reports are sent to the output file.
<p>
Timing the operations can be expensive, especially
in Solaris and Macintosh systems.  On Linux systems,
<tt>set(clocks)</tt> typically adds 5% -- 10% to the run time.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option bell -->
<a name="bell">
<pre class="my_option">
set(bell).    % default set
clear(bell).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, Prover9 beeps when important things happen,
such as proofs and warnings.  Some users run searches
that find hundreds of proofs, and they clear this flag
to prevent all of the beeping.
