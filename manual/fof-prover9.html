<h1>FOF-Prover9</h1>

FOF (First-Order Formula) reduction is a method of attempting to
simplify a problem by reducing it to an equivalent set of
independent subproblems.  A trivial example is to reduce the
conjecture <tt>A <-> B</tt> to the pair of problems
<tt>A -> B</tt> and <tt>B -> A</tt>.

<p>
The problem reduction uses a miniscope method
[<a href="references.html#Champeaux-miniscope">Champeaux-miniscope</a>]
that is quite powerful in some cases, but
it can easily blow up on complex formulas.
Therefore, if the reduction procedure fails to
terminate within a few seconds, or if the subproblems it produces are
more complex than the original problem, the reduction attempt is aborted
(and the user may wish to try the ordinary Prover9 program instead).
If the reduction succeeds, each subproblem is given to the
ordinary Prover9 search module.

<p>
Input files accepted by FOF-Prover9 are the same as those
accepted by Prover9, and when FOF-Prover9 runs the search
module on a subproblem, is uses all of the options given
in the input file.

<h2>An Example of FOF Reduction</h2>

This example was given by Peter Andrews as a challenge problem for resolution
systems in the 1970s.  FOF-Prover9's miniscope procedure reduces it to 32
trivial subproblems.  (More powerful miniscope methods can solve the problem
by reducing it to 0 subproblems.)

<pre class="my_job">
fof-prover9 -f <a href="andrews.in">andrews.in</a> &gt; <a href="andrews.out">andrews.out</a>
</pre>

Here is the same input run with ordinary Prover9.

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="andrews.in">andrews.in</a> &gt; <a href="andrews.out2">andrews.out2</a>
</pre>

The preceding example is artificial and seems tailor-made for FOF reduction.
Other, more realistic examples can be found in the
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/examples">
standard set of Prover9 examples</a>.
