<h1>Prover9 Input Files</h1>

Prover9 takes its input from one or more (usually one) files.
If there is more than one input file, lists of objects
(formulas, weighting rules, etc.) cannot be
split across more than one file.
The page <a href="running.html">Running Prover9</a>
shows how to specify the files in the commands to run Prover9.

<h2>Comments and Whitespace</h2>

There are two kinds of comment:

<ul>
<li><i>Line comment</i>.  If the first '<tt>%</tt>' (percent sign) on a line
is not the start of a block comment ('<tt>%BEGIN</tt>'), everything from that symbol
through the end of the line is ignored.
<li><i>Block comment</i>.  If the parser sees the string '<tt>%BEGIN</tt>',
that is not in a line comment,
it will ignore everything up through the next occurrence of '<tt>END%</tt>'.
Line breaks are irrelevant.  If there is no '<tt>END%</tt>', the rest of
the file is ignored, without causing an error.
</ul>

<p>
Comments are not echoed to the output file.  Clauses can have
<a href="attributes.html">label attributes</a> which can serve as
different kind of comment which <i>does</i> appear in the output file.

<p>
Whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, etc.) is optional in most
places.  The important exception is that whitespace is
required around some operations in clauses and formulas
(see the page <a href="syntax.html">Clauses and Formulas</a>).

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>

The most basic kind of input file consists of list of <a href="glossary.html#clause">clauses</a> named
"<tt>sos</tt>" representing the negation of the conjecture, as in
the following example.
<pre class="my_file">
formulas(sos).           % clauses to be placed in the sos list
  -man(x) | mortal(x).
  man(george).
  -mortal(george).
end_of_list.
</pre>
Prover9 will take the clauses, use its automatic mode to 
decide on the inference rules, and then search for a refutation.

<p>
The preceding example can also be stated in a more natural
way by using a non-clausal formula for the man-implies-mortal rule and the
<a href="goals.html"><tt>goals</tt> list</a> for the conclusion, as follows.
<pre class="my_file">
formulas(assumptions).   % synonym for formulas(sos).
  man(x) -> mortal(x).   % <a href="glossary.html#">open formula</a> with <a href="glossary.html#">free variable</a> x
  man(george).
end_of_list.

formulas(goals).         % to be negated and placed in the sos list
  mortal(george).
end_of_list.
</pre>
Prover9 will transform the formulas in this input to
the same clauses as in the basic input above before
starting the search for a refutation.

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
In Otter and in earlier versions of Prover9,
"clauses" and "formulas" were distinct types of object,
and formulas could not have free variables.
Now, clauses are a subset of formulas, and Prover9 decides
which formulas are non-clausal and takes the appropriate
actions to transform them to clauses.
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="lists">Types of Input</a></h2>

Prover9 input consists of lists of objects (formulas or terms)
and commands.

<h3>Lists of Objects</h3>

Lists of objects start with a type (<tt>formulas</tt> or <tt>terms</tt>)
and name (<tt>sos</tt>, <tt>goals</tt>, <tt>weights</tt>, etc.),
and end with <tt>end_of_list</tt>.  The following display show an example
of each type of accepted list, with one object in each list.

<pre class="my_file">
formulas(sos).           p(x).     end_of_list.   % the primary input list
formulas(assumptions).   p(x).     end_of_list.   % synonym for formulas(sos)
formulas(goals).         p(x).     end_of_list.   % some restrictions (see <a href="goals.html">Goals</a>)
formulas(usable).        p(x).     end_of_list.   % seldom used
formulas(demodulators).  f(x)=x.   end_of_list.   % seldom used, must be equalities
formulas(hints).         p(x).     end_of_list.   % should be used more often  (see <a href="hints.html">Hints</a>)

list(weights).         weight(a) = 10.                         end_of_list. % see <a href="weight.html">Weighting</a>
list(kbo_weights).     a = 3.                                  end_of_list. % see <a href="term-order.html">Term Ordering</a>
list(actions).         given = 100 -> set(print_kept).         end_of_list. % see <a href="actions.html">Actions</a>
list(interpretations). interpretation(2,[],[relation(p,[1])]). end_of_list. % see <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>
</pre>
If the input contains more than one list of a particular type/name, the lists
are simply concatenated by Prover9 as they are read.

<h3>Commands</h3>

Eleven types of command are accepted.  Here is an example of each.

<pre class="my_file">
op(400, infix_right, ["+", "--"]). % declare parse precedence and type (see <a href="syntax.html#declarations">Clauses and Formulas</a>)

redeclare(negation, "~"]).         % change the negation symbol (see <a href="syntax.html#redeclare">Clauses and Formulas</a>)

set(print_kept).                   % set a flag

clear(auto_inference).             % clear a flag

assign(max_weight, 40).            % integer parameter

assign(stats, some).               % string parameter

assoc_comm(*).                     % not currently used for Prover9

commutative(g).                    % not currently used for Prover9

predicate_order([=,<=,P,Q).        % predicate symbol precedence (see <a href="term-order.html">Term Ordering</a>)

function_order([0,1,a,b,f,g,*,+]). % function symbol precedence (see <a href="term-order.html">Term Ordering</a>)

lex([0,1,a,b,f,g,*,+]).            % synonym for "function_order"

skolem([a,b,f,g]).                 % declare symbols to be Skolem functions (rarely used)
</pre>

<h2>Order of Commands and Lists of Objects</h2>

For the most part, the order of things in the input file(s) is irrelevant.
For example, commands can usually be mixed with lists of objects.
The situations in which order matters are listed here.

<ul>
<li>The <tt>op(precedence, type, symbols)</tt> commands must occur
before any clauses or formulas that contain the affected symbols.
<li>Some of the flags and parameters alter other flags and parameters.
The alterations can be undone by placing the appropriate command
after the command that alters.  The output file clearly shows
what happens in these cases.
</ul>

Note that changing the order of clauses or formulas within a list,
changing the order of literals in a clause,
or changing the order of subformulas in a formula
can change the search, occasionally in substantial ways.

<h2>Conditional Inclusion</h2>

Many input files can be used for multiple programs (e.g., Prover9 and Mace4).
The following construct says to include the enclosed input
for the given program only.

<pre class="my_file">
if(<font color="#D10000"><i>program-name</i></font>).
   <font color="#D10000"><i>... conditionally-included input ...</i></font>
end_if.
</pre>

For example, to specify that Mace4 and Prover9 have different time limits,
one can write
<pre class="my_file">
if(Mace4).
  assign(max_seconds, 30).
end_if.

if(Prover9).
  assign(max_seconds, 3600).
end_if.
</pre>

The conditional-inclusion construct cannot occur within a list of
objects (formulas, weighting rules, etc.).
