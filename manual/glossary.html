<h2>Terms, Clauses, Formulas, Interpretations</h2>

These definitions apply to first-order unsorted logic.
See a book on first-order logic for more formal definitions
of these concepts.

<i>Term</i>
<blockquote>
A recursive definition of first-order unsorted <i class="g">terms</i>.
<ul>
<li>A variable is a term,
<li>a constant is a term, and
<li>an <i>n</i>-ary function symbol applied to <i>n</i> terms is a term.
</ul>

<i>Atomic Formula</i>
<blockquote>
An <i>n</i>-ary predicate symbol applied to <i>n</i> terms
is an <i class="g">atomic formula</i>.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<!-- start def formula -->
<a name="formula">

<i>Formula</i>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An atomic formula is a formula,
<li>if <tt>F</tt> and <tt>G</tt> are formulas, then the following are formulas.
<ul>
<li><tt>(-F)</tt>
<li><tt>(F | G)</tt>
<li><tt>(F & G)</tt>
<li><tt>(F -> G)</tt>
<li><tt>(F <-> G)</tt>
</ul>
<li>if <tt>F</tt> is a formula and <tt>x</tt> is a variable, then the
following are formulas.
<ul>
<li><tt>(all x F)</tt>
<li><tt>(exists x F)</tt>
</ul>
</ul>
When writing formulas for Prover9, many of the parentheses can be
omitted;  see the page <a href="syntax.html">Clauses and Formulas</a>
tor the parsing rules.

<i>Free Variables</i>
<blockquote>
A <i class="g">free variable</i> is a variable not bound by any quantifier.
A <i class="g">closed formula</i> has no free variables.
An <i class="g">open formula</i> has at least one free variable.
<p>
Prover9's default rule for distinguishing free variables
from constants is that free varaibles start with (lower case)
'<tt>u</tt>' through '<tt>z</tt>'.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<!-- start def literal -->
<a name="literal">

<i>Literal</i>
<blockquote>
A <i class="g">literal</i> is either an

<!-- start def clause -->
<!-- start def clauses -->
<a name="clause">

<i>Clause</i>
<blockquote>
A <i class="g">clause</i> is a formula consisting of a disjunction of literals.
All variables in a clause are
assumed to be universally quantified.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<!-- start def interpretation -->
<a name="interpretation">

<i>Interpretation</i>
<blockquote>
An <i class="g">interpretation</i> of a first-order language consists of
<ul>
<li> of a set of objects called the <i class="g">domain</i>,
<li> an <i>n</i>-ary function over the domain into the domain for
     each <i>n</i>-ary function symbol in the language,
<li> an <i>n</i>-ary relation over the domain for
     each <i>n</i>-ary predicate symbol in the language.
</ul>
</blockquote>
Given an interpretation, each term in the language
evaluates to a member of the domain, and
each clause or
closed formula in the language evaluates to TRUE or to FALSE.

<h2>Logic Transformations</h2>

<hr>
<!-- start def negation normal form -->
<!-- start def NNF -->
<a name="NNF">

<i>Negation Normal Form (NNF)</i>
<blockquote>
A formula is in <i class="g">negation normal form</i>
if the only logic connectives are
negation, conjunction, disjunction, quantification (universal or existential),
and if all negation operations are applied directly to atomic formulas.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<!-- start def conjunctive normal form -->

<a name="CNF">

<i>Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)</i>
<blockquote>
This definition applies to quantifier-free formulas.
<p>
A formula is in <i class="g">conjunctive normal form</i>
if (1) the only logic connectives
are negation, conjunction, and disjunction,
(2) no negation is applied to a conjunction or a disjunction,
and (3) no disjunction is applied to a conjunction.
<p>
Alternate definition: A formula is in CNF if it is a clause or a
conjunction of clauses.

<!-- start def skolemization -->
<!-- start def Skolem constant -->
<!-- start def Skolem function -->
<!-- start def Skolem -->
<a name="skolemization">

<i>Skolemization</i>
<blockquote>
</i>Skolemization</i> is the process of replacing
existentially quantified variables
in a formula with new constants (called <i class="g">Skolem constants</i>) or
functions (called <i class="g">Skolem functions</i>).  If an existential
quantifier is in the scope of some universal quantifiers, the
new symbol is a function of the corresponding universally quantified
variables.
The result of Skolemization is not, strictly speaking, equivalent to
the original formula, because new symbols may have been introduced,
but the result is inconsistent iff the the original formula is
inconsistent.

<hr>
<!-- start def clause normal form -->
<!-- start def clausification -->
<!-- start def clausify -->
<a name="clausification">

<i>Clausification</i>
<blockquote>
<i class="g">Clausification</i> is the process of translating a formula
into a conjunction of clauses.  A standard way is
NNF conversion, Skolemization, moving universal quantifiers
to the top (renaming bound variables if necessary),
CNF conversion, and finally removing universal quantifiers.
The variables in each resulting clause are implicitly
universally quantified.
<p>
Each step produces an equivalent formula, except for
Skolemization, which produces an equiconsistent formula,
so the result of Clausification is inconsistent iff
the original formula is inconsistent.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<!-- start universal closure -->

<i>Universal Closure</i>
<blockquote>
The <i class="g">universal closure</i> of a formula is constructed by universally
quantifying, at the top of the formula, all free variables
in the formula.

by Prover9 (LPO, KBO, RPO) are, in general, only partial, so clauses
do not necessarily have greatest literals.

<i>Binary Resolution</i>
<blockquote>
The inference rule <i class="g">binary resolution</i>
takes two clauses containing
unifiable literals of opposite sign and produces a clause
consisting of the remaining literals to which the most general
unifying substitution has been applied.  The rule can be viewed
as a generalization of modus ponens.
<p>
Restrictions on Binary Resolution.

inferences can be restricted to <a href="glossary.html#maximal">maximal literals</a>.
<p>
<i class="g">Literal selection</i> is a restriction of resolution
or paramdulation.  In each clause, some subset of the
negative literals are marked as selected (the selection
may be arbitrary), and in some cases inferences can be
restricted to selected literals.

<i>Factoring</i>
<blockquote>
The inference rule <i class="g">factoring</i> takes one clause containing two or more
literals (of the same sign) that all unify.  The most general unifying
substitution is applied to the parent, and the unified literals
become identical and are merged into one.
<p>
Factoring in Prover9 is binary, operating on two literals
at a time.

<i>Hyperresolution</i>
<blockquote>
The <i class="g">hyperresolution</i> inference rule 
(also called positive hyperresolution)
takes a non-positive clause (called the
<i class="g">nucleus</i>) and simultaneously resolves each of its negative
literals with positive clauses (called the <i class="g">satellites</i>),
producing a positive clause.  Hyperresolution can be viewed as a
sequence of positive binary resolution steps ending with a positive
clause.
<p>
Negative hyperresolution is similar to hyperresolution but with the
signs reversed.

is selected from the

<i>Sos List, Assumptions List, Usable List</i>
<blockquote>
During the search, the <i class="g">usable</i> list is the list of clauses that
are available for making inferences with the
<a href="glossary.html#given-clause">given clause</a>, and
the <i class="g">sos list</i> is the list of clauses that
are waiting to be selected as
<a href="glossary.html#given-clause">given clause</a>s.
Clauses in the sos list are not available for making primary inferences,
but they can be used to simplify inferred clauses by
<a href="glossary.html#demodulation">demodulation</a> and

<p>
The <i class="g">assumptions list</i> is identical to the sos list; that is,
"assumptions" is a synonym for "sos".
<p>
Prover9 also accepts non-clausal formulas in lists named usable or sos.
Such formulas are transformed to clauses which are placed in the
clause list of the same name.
<p>
The name "sos" is used because it can be employed to achieve the
set-of-support strategy, which requires that all lines of reasoning
start with a subset of the input clauses called the set of support.
The clauses or formulas in the initial set of support are placed
the sos list, and the rest of the clauses or formulas are placed in the
usable list.
