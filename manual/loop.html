<h1>The Inference Loop</h1>

The <i>main loop</i> for inferring and processing clauses
and searching for a proof is sometimes called the <i>given
clause algorithm</i>.
It operates mainly on the <tt>sos</tt> and <tt>usable</tt> lists.

<pre class="my_code">
While the sos list is not empty:
    1. <a href="select.html">Select a given clause</a> from sos and move it to the usable list;
    2. <a href="inf-rules.html">Infer new clauses</a> using the inference rules in effect;
       each new clause must have the given clause as one of its
       parents and members of the usable list as its other parents;
    3. <a href="process-inf.html">process each new clause</a>;
    4. append new clauses that pass the retention tests to the sos list.
end of while loop.
</pre>

<h2>Two Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<blockquote>
<i>At some point in the search,
Prover9 has all of the clauses needed to make an important
inference, and one of the potential parents is selected as
the given clause.  But Prover9 fails to make the inference.
Why is that?</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>Why do all parents have to be in the <tt>usable</tt> list?</i>
</blockquote>

The answer to both questions is the same, and it has to do
with redundancy.  Assume 
<ul>
<li>clause <i>C</i> can be inferred from clauses
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>;
<li>both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are in the
<tt>sos</tt> list; and
<li><i>A</i> is selected first.
</ul>
According to the algorithm, <i>C</i> is not derived
until <i>B</i> has also been selected.
Otherwise, <i>C</i> would be derived twice from
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.

<h2>Variations of the Loop</h2>

<p>
There are two common versions of the given clause algorithm
that differ in how and when simplification (i.e., rewriting) occurs.

<p>
In the <i>Otter loop</i>, which Prover9 uses, clauses in
the <tt>sos</tt> list can simplify new clauses,
and new simplifiers are applied immediately to all clauses,
including <tt>sos</tt> clauses.

<p>
In the <i>Discount loop</i>, clauses in the <tt>sos</tt>
list (also called the <i>passive list</i>) cannot simplify
or be simplified until they are selected as given clauses.

<p>
The tradeoff between the two versions is
straightforward --- the Otter loop spends much more time
simplifying with the possible benefit of
making an important simplification sooner.
